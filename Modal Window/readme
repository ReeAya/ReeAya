## Overview

This is an interactive page which displays a modal window when the 'Click Me' button is clicked. This was done by using JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use JavaScript to add and remove classes to HTML elements, as well as how to manipulate styles in CSS. I learned how to use eventListeners and what different events go within the parentheses of these methods.

See a code snippet below:

```js
document.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {
  console.log(event.key);

  if (event.key === 'Escape' && !modal.classList.contains('hidden')) {
    closeModal();
  }
});
```

### Continued development

I would love to learn more about the removal and addition of different classes and what else can be manipulated.
